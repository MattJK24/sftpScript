# sftpScript
Combination of a bash script and batch file for sftp automation.
This script was written for my personal use on macOS. Learning how to use sftp and batch files took long enough for me to figure out that I thought I should share. 
In order to run, all comments must be removed from the batch file as comments are not supported.
